# Inventory Management Project
The Inventory Management System is designed to help businesses efficiently manage and monitor their product inventory. It automates the tracking of stock levels, alerts when products are out of stock or below a predefined minimum threshold, and eliminates the need for manual stock counting. The system also tracks product inflow and outflow, supports detailed reporting, and organizes products into categories for easy identification, search, and filtering. Each product is assigned a unique ID along with metadata like name, quantity, creator, and creation date to ensure clear and organized inventory records.

Get Notify ‚Äì Receive notifications for out-of-stock or low-inventory items.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying the application with every code change. This improves code quality, reduces manual errors, and speeds up development. Tools like GitHub Actions can be used to run tests and deploy the app automatically. Docker may also be used to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
